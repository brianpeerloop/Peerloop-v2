## Current Session Work

### Session Start - Context Recovery
- Used /q-begin to load session context
- Read vibe-coder-profile.md, project.md, session-log.md
- Discovered Session 7 was the last documented session

### Undocumented Work Discovery
- Found several mockup files created after Session 7 that weren't documented:
  - mockup-dashboard-v5.html
  - mockup-feed-centric.html
  - mockup-workspace-concept.html
  - mockup-community-v2.html
  - mockup-community-v3-sidebar.html
- Read all mockups to understand design directions explored:
  - Dashboard v5: Refined mobile, indigo palette, polished stats cards
  - Feed-Centric: Twitter-style with learning embeds, polls, video previews
  - Workspace: Discord-style creator rail, personalized welcome
  - Community v3: Full Twitter/X desktop with inline creator profiles

### Major Design Pivot - "The Learning Commons"
User explained critical insight from lost session:
> "The live algorithmic feeds will have as much or more learning opportunities than the live sessions we host. So the feeds are critical to the entire site."

This changes everything - feeds ARE the learning, not just social features.

### Critique of Twitter/X for Learning
Identified problems with Twitter/X model for education:
- Infinite scroll optimizes for addiction, not understanding
- Chronological chaos - no sense of progression
- Shallow engagement - like and move on
- Everything looks the same - tips look like jokes
- Ephemeral - good insights disappear
- No "finished" state - never caught up

### "Learning Commons" Concept Development
Designed new approach from first principles:
- **Finite, not infinite** - Clear "You're caught up!" state
- **Typed content** - Tips, Questions, Challenges, Wins (each looks different)
- **Active actions** - "Got it ✓" marks understanding, not just "like"
- **Course context** - Every card shows which course it's from
- **Journey visibility** - Always see Learn → Certify → Teach → Earn progress
- **Peer awareness** - See who's learning alongside you
- **Intentional saving** - Build personal knowledge library

### Created Learning Commons Mockup
Built mockup-learning-commons.html with:
- 3-column desktop layout (Left nav + Main commons + Right context)
- **Left Sidebar:** Navigation + Your Creators with live indicators
- **Main Content:**
  - Live Now banner (someone is teaching)
  - Next Session countdown
  - "Fresh Knowledge" feed with typed cards:
    - 💡 Tip cards with "Got it ✓" / Save / Discuss
    - ❓ Question cards with answer previews
    - 🎯 Challenge cards with time limits and participant counts
    - 🎉 Win cards with celebration reactions
  - "You're caught up!" state (finite, not infinite)
  - Filter by type (All / Tips / Questions / Challenges)
- **Right Sidebar:**
  - Your Journey (Learn → Certify → Teach → Earn)
  - Course progress bars
  - Peers Online (people in same course)
  - Your Library (saved items with review reminders)

### Plugin Discussion
- Discussed feature-dev plugin from claude-plugins-official
- Explained plugin provides specialized agents for:
  - Codebase exploration
  - Architecture design
  - Quality review
- User installed the plugin

## Summary

### All Accomplishments (Complete List)

**From Checkpoint (earlier in day):**
1. Reviewed existing dashboard mockup
2. Designed Role-Based Toggle approach (Learning/Teaching)
3. Created mockup-dashboard-v2.html
4. Created mockup-dashboard-v3.html
5. Analyzed P0 MVP requirements
6. Created mockup-dashboard-v4.html (final dashboard design)
7. Removed calendars from main dashboard
8. Designed sub-pages architecture (Students, Earnings, Availability)

**From Current Session:**
9. Recovered context from undocumented mockups (v5, feed-centric, workspace, community)
10. Captured critical insight: feeds ARE the learning experience
11. Critiqued Twitter/X model for education
12. Designed "Learning Commons" concept from first principles
13. Created mockup-learning-commons.html with finite feeds, typed content, active engagement
14. Explained feature-dev plugin functionality
15. User installed feature-dev plugin

### Files Changed

**Created:**
- `my-project/code/public/mockup-learning-commons.html` - The Learning Commons design

**Modified:**
- None

**Previously Created (from checkpoint):**
- `my-project/code/public/mockup-dashboard-v2.html`
- `my-project/code/public/mockup-dashboard-v3.html`
- `my-project/code/public/mockup-dashboard-v4.html`

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Feeds are central to learning | Algorithmic feeds provide as many learning opportunities as live sessions |
| Reject Twitter/X infinite scroll | Optimizes for addiction, not understanding |
| Finite content batches | "You're caught up!" respects user time, enables intentional learning |
| Typed content cards | Tips, Questions, Challenges, Wins each have different visual treatment and actions |
| "Got it ✓" instead of "Like" | Marks understanding, not just approval |
| Course context on every card | Users need to know where knowledge fits in their journey |
| Peers Online sidebar | Learning is social - show who's on the same path |
| Saved items become "Your Library" | Knowledge should accumulate, not disappear |

## Next Session Recommendations

- [ ] Review Learning Commons mockup with stakeholders
- [ ] Decide on implementation priority (Dashboard v4 or Learning Commons)
- [ ] Use feature-dev plugin to plan implementation
- [ ] Consider mobile version of Learning Commons
- [ ] Test "You're caught up!" concept with users
