## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Implement Option A design | User explicitly said "I love option A. Can you implement that" |
| Two-panel toggle (Hub vs Creators) | Simplifies UX by making the posting context obvious at a glance |
| Creator cards as horizontal row | Easy to scroll and select, visual representation of each creator |
| Hide legacy tabs (not delete) | Preserves functionality if needed to revert, doesn't break existing logic |
| Clear "Posting to:" label | Removes all ambiguity about where posts will go |

---

## Current Status

**Working on:** Option A implementation complete, ready for testing
**Partially complete:** Browser testing (accessibility snapshot had limited visibility)

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] User to test the new Community interface in browser
- [ ] Verify creator selection cards work correctly when following creators
- [ ] Confirm posting to Community Hub vs specific creator works as expected
- [ ] Potential styling refinements based on user feedback
- [ ] Consider adding hover states to creator cards
- [ ] May need to adjust feed filtering based on mode selection

---

## Technical Notes

- App running on port 3001 (port 3000 was in use)
- Compiled successfully after multiple syntax error fixes
- New states added: `communityMode` (default: 'hub'), `selectedCreatorId` (default: null)
- Legacy horizontal tabs hidden with `display: 'none'` style
