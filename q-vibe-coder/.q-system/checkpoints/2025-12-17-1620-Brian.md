**Session started:** ~16:00
**Checkpoint time:** 2025-12-17-1620
**Participant:** Brian

## Accomplishments So Far

- Reviewed session context from previous checkpoint (community-redesign-december-17 branch)
- Discussed Goodwill Points system - summarized from documentation files
- Fixed "Your Creators" sidebar section positioning - now appears directly under Light Mode menu
- Made Community profile card sticky - stays fixed at top when scrolling through posts
- Tested both changes in browser with screenshots

---

## Files Changed

**Modified:**
- `my-project/code/src/components/Sidebar.css` (line 109)
  - Changed `.sidebar-nav { flex: 1; }` to `.sidebar-nav { flex: none; }`
  - This prevents nav from growing to fill space, keeping "Your Creators" section directly below

- `my-project/code/src/components/Community.css` (lines 1446-1461)
  - Added sticky positioning to `.community-profile-card`:
    - `position: sticky; top: 0; z-index: 100;`
  - Updated background gradients to include solid fallback for proper overlay

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Use `flex: none` instead of removing flex entirely | Maintains flexbox context while preventing growth |
| Add solid background to sticky profile card | Ensures posts don't show through when scrolling underneath |
| z-index: 100 for profile card | High enough to stay on top, leaves room for modals/dropdowns |

## Current Status

**Working on:** UI polish for Community tab
**Branch:** `community-redesign-december-17`
**Partially complete:** Community redesign implementation

## Next Steps

- [ ] Test sticky profile card with creator profiles (not just Commons)
- [ ] Commit current CSS changes
- [ ] Continue with remaining Community features from checkpoint
- [ ] Consider implementing Dashboard mockup (from previous session plans)
