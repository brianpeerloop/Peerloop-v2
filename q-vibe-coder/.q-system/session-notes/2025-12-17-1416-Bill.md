# Session Notes: 2025-12-17-1416-Bill

**Summary:** Major design pivot for PeerLoop. Established that algorithmic feeds are as important as live sessions for learning, critiqued Twitter/X model, and designed "The Learning Commons" - a feed-first interface with finite content batches, typed cards (Tips, Questions, Challenges, Wins), and active engagement actions like "Got it ✓" instead of passive likes.

---

## Key Accomplishments

- Recovered undocumented design work from previous session (5 mockups found)
- Captured critical insight: "Feeds ARE the learning" - not just social features
- Critiqued Twitter/X infinite scroll model for education (addiction vs understanding)
- Designed "Learning Commons" concept from first principles:
  - Finite batches with "You're caught up!" state
  - Typed content cards (Tips, Questions, Challenges, Wins)
  - Active actions: "Got it ✓" / Save / Discuss
  - Course context on every piece of content
  - Journey visibility (Learn → Certify → Teach → Earn)
  - Peer awareness (who's learning alongside you)
- Created comprehensive mockup-learning-commons.html
- Discussed and user installed feature-dev plugin for future implementation

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Feeds are central to learning | Algorithmic feeds provide as many learning opportunities as live sessions |
| Reject infinite scroll | Twitter/X model optimizes for addiction, not understanding |
| Finite content batches | "You're caught up!" respects time, enables intentional learning |
| Typed content cards | Different visuals/actions for Tips, Questions, Challenges, Wins |
| "Got it ✓" action | Marks understanding, not just approval - active learning |
| Course context everywhere | Users need to know where knowledge fits in their journey |
| Peers Online feature | Learning is social - show who's on the same path |

## Next Actions

- [ ] Review Learning Commons mockup - gather feedback
- [ ] Decide implementation priority: Dashboard v4 or Learning Commons first
- [ ] Use feature-dev plugin to plan implementation architecture
- [ ] Design mobile version of Learning Commons
- [ ] Test "You're caught up!" finite feed concept with users
- [ ] Consider Learning Deck (card-by-card) variant for mobile
