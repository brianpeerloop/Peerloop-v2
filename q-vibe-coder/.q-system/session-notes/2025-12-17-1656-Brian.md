# Session Notes: 2025-12-17-1656-Brian

**Summary:** Implemented sticky header for creator profiles (profile card + course tabs stay fixed while posts scroll), added scrollable course tabs with arrow buttons and drag-to-scroll, made "Your Creators" sidebar persistent across all pages, and fixed navigation when clicking creators from the sidebar on non-Community pages.

## Key Accomplishments

- Sticky header for creator profiles - profile card AND feed tabs stay fixed at top
- Scrollable course tabs with left/right arrow buttons
- Drag-to-scroll functionality for course tabs (grab cursor)
- "Your Creators" sidebar now visible on ALL pages (Browse, Dashboard, Notifications, etc.)
- Fixed sidebar creator click navigation - works from any page
- Sidebar positioning - "Your Creators" directly under Light Mode menu

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Single sticky wrapper for profile + tabs | Simpler than multiple sticky elements with calculated offsets |
| localStorage for creator selection persistence | Survives React navigation and re-renders |
| Scroll arrows + drag together | Accessibility (arrows) + convenience (drag) |
| 150px scroll amount | Comfortable scroll distance |
