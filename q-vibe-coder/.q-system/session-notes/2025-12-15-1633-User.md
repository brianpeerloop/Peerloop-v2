# Session Notes: 2025-12-15-1633-User

**Summary:** Major overhaul of the follow system to separate creator follows from course purchases. Creators can be followed freely for Town Hall access, while courses require purchase before follow/unfollow. Also redesigned Creator Profiles with a new card layout featuring a compact left profile box.

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Only creators can be followed | Simplifies model - Town Hall access is free, course content requires purchase |
| Courses require purchase for follow/unfollow | Users toggle only courses they've paid for |
| Auto-follow purchased courses on re-follow | Don't lose access to paid content |
| Compact left profile box (140px) | New design without taking too much space |
