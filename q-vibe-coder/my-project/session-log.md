## Sessions

### Session 1
**Date:** December 3, 2025
**Duration:** ~15 min
**Phase:** Setup & Import

**What we did:**
- Created user profile (some coding experience, uses Cursor/GitHub/Claude)
- Imported PeerLoopInterface React app from C:\Alpha\PeerLoopInterface
- Installed dependencies
- Started dev server
- Documented project in project.md

**Decisions made:**
- Working within q-vibe-coder framework
- Will push to GitHub repo after setup
- Awaiting business model docs for context

**Next session:** Review app, discuss features to expand/clean up, set up GitHub repo


---

### Session 2
**Date:** December 4, 2025
**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Phase:** Building & Polish

**What we did:**
- Added "Welcome to your communities" message with info tooltip to Community tab
- Positioned message next to "Everyone" dropdown in post composer
- Updated tooltip text: "Go to Browse and follow courses or Creators. Feeds will show in your community here"
- **Cleaned up Course Listing:**
  - Removed fake "Student-Teachers: 158 | Avg. Taught: 12" stats line
  - Removed confusing action icons row (chat, repost, heart, bookmark, share)
  - Truncated descriptions to 2 lines max with ellipsis
- Fixed runtime error in course detail view (added null checks)
- Multiple deployments to GitHub Pages
- Started fresh dev server on port 3001 for testing

**Decisions made:**
- Course cards should be clean and scannable (removed clutter)
- Keep action icons only where they make sense (Community posts, not course listings)
- Descriptions truncated for better scannability

**Technical notes:**
- Dev server running on http://localhost:3001/Peerloopapp
- GitHub Pages: https://brianpeerloop.github.io/Peerloopapp/

**Next session:** Continue UI polish, verify course listing changes visible

### Session 3
**Date:** December 6, 2025
**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Phase:** Building & Bug Fixes

**What we did:**
- Implemented 0.5-second auto-hide tooltip for sidebar icons on mobile
- Reduced "Post here" textarea size for cleaner UI

  - Restored src/data/users.js (28 community user profiles)
  - Restored UserProfile.js, CourseDetailView.js, Settings.js/css

- **Layout Overhaul - Centered 2-Column Design:**
  - Removed all right panes (Browse, Community, Teaching)
  - Centered entire app (sidebar + content) as a unit
  - Sidebar: 240px with labels, Content: 650px
  - Total centered width: 890px
- **Responsive Sidebar:**
  - Shows text labels on wide screens (> 950px)
  - Collapses to icon-only (88px) on narrow screens
