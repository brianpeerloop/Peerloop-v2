## Sessions

### Session 1
**Date:** December 3, 2025
**Duration:** ~15 min
**Phase:** Setup & Import

**What we did:**
- Created user profile (some coding experience, uses Cursor/GitHub/Claude)
- Imported PeerLoopInterface React app from C:\Alpha\PeerLoopInterface
- Installed dependencies
- Started dev server
- Documented project in project.md

**Decisions made:**
- Working within q-vibe-coder framework
- Will push to GitHub repo after setup
- Awaiting business model docs for context

**Next session:** Review app, discuss features to expand/clean up, set up GitHub repo

### Session 2
**Date:** December 4, 2025
**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Phase:** Building & Polish

**What we did:**
- Added "Welcome to your communities" message with info tooltip to Community tab
- Positioned message next to "Everyone" dropdown in post composer
- Updated tooltip text: "Go to Browse and follow courses or Creators. Feeds will show in your community here"
- **Cleaned up Course Listing:**
  - Removed fake "Student-Teachers: 158 | Avg. Taught: 12" stats line
  - Removed confusing action icons row (chat, repost, heart, bookmark, share)
  - Truncated descriptions to 2 lines max with ellipsis
- Fixed runtime error in course detail view (added null checks)
- Multiple deployments to GitHub Pages
- Started fresh dev server on port 3001 for testing

**Decisions made:**
- Course cards should be clean and scannable (removed clutter)
- Keep action icons only where they make sense (Community posts, not course listings)
- Descriptions truncated for better scannability

**Technical notes:**
- Dev server running on http://localhost:3001/Peerloopapp
- GitHub Pages: https://brianpeerloop.github.io/Peerloopapp/

**Next session:** Continue UI polish, verify course listing changes visible

### Session 3
**Date:** December 6, 2025
**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Phase:** Building & Bug Fixes

**What we did:**
- Implemented 0.5-second auto-hide tooltip for sidebar icons on mobile
- Reduced "Post here" textarea size for cleaner UI
- Made all right panes consistent width at 315px (10% reduction)
- **Major fix:** Recovered lost user profiles from git history
  - Restored src/data/users.js (28 community user profiles)
  - Restored UserProfile.js, CourseDetailView.js, Settings.js/css
  - Restored clickable usernames and course links in Community
- Deployed all fixes to GitHub Pages

**Decisions made:**
- 0.5 second tooltip duration (tested 5s, 2s, 1s first)
- 315px right pane width for more content space
- Full file restore from git commit f89811f rather than manual merge

**Technical notes:**
- Used `git checkout f89811f -- [files]` to restore deleted files
- Files were accidentally removed in commits after Dec 5
- Windows PowerShell shell output issues worked around by reading terminal files

**Next session:** Test all user profile links, verify Settings page works

### Session 4
**Date:** December 10, 2025
**Duration:** ~1.5 hours
**Phase:** Building & Layout Overhaul

**What we did:**
- **Fresh GitHub Start:** Cleaned Peerloop-v2 repo, imported project from C:\Alpha\q-vibe-coder with no git history
- **Layout Overhaul - Centered 2-Column Design:**
  - Removed all right panes (Browse, Community, Teaching)
  - Centered entire app (sidebar + content) as a unit
  - Sidebar: 240px with labels, Content: 650px
  - Total centered width: 890px
- **Responsive Sidebar:**
  - Shows text labels on wide screens (> 950px)
  - Collapses to icon-only (88px) on narrow screens
- **Connected Enroll Button to Calendar Flow:**
  - Found existing EnrollmentFlow.js component (was disconnected)
  - Connected "Enroll Now" button to open calendar modal
  - Modal shows student-teacher availability and time slots
- Updated .gitignore to only exclude .env and node_modules

**Decisions made:**
- 650px content width (Twitter-like readable width)
- Centered layout for focused UI
- 950px breakpoint for sidebar collapse
- All pages use same consistent width

**Technical notes:**
- Dev server: http://localhost:3001/Peerloopapp
- GitHub: https://github.com/brianpeerloop/Peerloop-v2
- EnrollmentFlow has 4 mock student-teachers with availability data

**Next session:** Test enrollment flow, verify responsive behavior, continue feature development

### Session 5
**Date:** December 11, 2025
**Duration:** ~3 hours
**Phase:** Building & Creator Profile Redesign

**What we did:**
- **Fixed Dropdown Positioning:**
  - Community creator dropdowns were appearing off-screen
  - Implemented React Portal to render dropdown at document.body level

- **Fixed Unfollow Functionality:**
  - Individual course unfollow wasn't working for creator-based follows
  - Fix: Unfollow now handles both direct course follows AND creator follow entries

- **Posts Now Filter by Audience:**
  - Posts filter correctly by creator tabs

- **Creator Links Redesign:**
  - Changed creator selection from squares to horizontal scrollable text links (X.com style)
  - Added scroll arrows for navigation

- **Major Creator Profile Redesign:**
  - Simplified from confusing multi-level menus to clean single-level layout
  - **Removed middle menu bar** (was: Courses | Community | Following tabs)
  - **New top buttons:** "Go to Community" and "Follow ▼" at top right
  - **Courses listed directly** below creator bio/credentials
  - **"Go to Community" toggles inline** - shows community feed on same page
  - Button changes to "View Courses" when viewing community
  - Click any course → opens full course detail with back button

- **UI Polish:**
  - Compact creator header with inline stats
  - Credentials listed below bio
  - Centered "BROWSE COURSES OR COURSE CREATORS" text
  - Tried multiple button styles (pills, segmented control) before settling on current design

**Decisions made:**
- Simplified creator profile to remove navigation confusion
- Community embedded inline on creator profile (toggle, not separate page)
- Clean course listings match Browse style
- Follow dropdown at top right for quick access

**Technical notes:**
- Dev server: http://localhost:3001/Peerloop-v2
- GitHub: https://github.com/brianpeerloop/Peerloop-v2
- `creatorProfileTab` state controls courses vs community view

**Next session:** 
- Test creator profile flow end-to-end
- Connect real community posts to creator profiles
- Consider course-specific thread filtering
