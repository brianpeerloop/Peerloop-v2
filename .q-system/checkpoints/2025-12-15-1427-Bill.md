## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| User avatar inside Post Box | Saves horizontal space, keeps it visible |
| Gray background for filter dropdown | Matches profile card styling |
| New User starts with no follows | Clean slate experience for demo |
| Clear localStorage on new user login | Ensures fresh state |
| Pre-filled login form for New User | Demo convenience, shows the flow |
